# Belly Button Burgers Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard is to help Roza, a biological researcher, visualize the bacterial data for the data she has collected. Her research focused on bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food start-up to research candidate species.
This dashboard will provide Rozaâ€™s volunteers the ability to visualize the panel of demographic information to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
